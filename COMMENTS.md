## Comments on UI/UX

1. The navigation button should have a different color than the background so that user can easily find the buttons (make it distinct from others).
2. Clickable links should show "pointer" instead of "default" cursor.
3. After adding to cart, "ADDED" notification should have a different background color for easier reading
4. Paddings can be adjusted for convenience especially in "/cart" page
5. Clear button in "/cart" page should have color
